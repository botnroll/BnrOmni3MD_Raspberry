## BnrOmni3MD_Raspberry

Botnroll Omni3MD library for RaspberryPi and other Linux-based ARM devices.

This library interfaces Omni3MD Omnidirectional motor controller using ARM's I2C Bus. It uses Linux native system calls (using i2c-dev lib) and includes every feature implemented in the original library (please refer to [Omni3MD Homepage](http://botnroll.com/omni3md/). 

This library is still in development and testing, it requires caution when using it. Problems caused to any hardware it's up to the user.
